# Home Lab

A Home Lab is an important tool for anyone who works with computers or enjoys tinkering with information technology.

Within my Home Lab, I have: 
- The Network - comprised of Ethernet switches, routers, wifi access points, cables etc.
- My Home Gateway Router - a Mikrotik ....
- A NAS - This is used for storing files but also does double duty as a Docker Container server.
- Stratum 1 NTP Server - Using GPS for time sync(Planning)
- CloudFlare DNS - Managed via Terraform
- IPv6 connectivity - Afrihost over Frogfroot Fibre(in progress)
- Google Workspaces
- PXE Boot server - used for provisioning new hardware and updating existing hardware(Planning)
